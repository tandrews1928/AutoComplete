# AutoComplete

Autocomplete is an algorithm where the user types the text and the application suggests possible completions for that text

To use run the AucocompleteMain class.


AutocompleteMain – the class where you will launch the GUI. When testing your
implementations of autocomplete, you will need to change the
String AUTOCOMPLETOR_CLASS_NAME’s value.

Node – a node class for use in TrieAutocomplete. Nothing needs to be modified here,
but definitely read through this class before starting TrieAutocomplete.

Term – allows us to use Comparable and Comparator to sort terms in a variety of ways

AutocompleteGUI – the GUI for this project.
